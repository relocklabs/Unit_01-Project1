# Unit_01-Project1
Hey guys thanks for stopping by! 

tech used : 

- lots of loops and some other stuff
- functions within functions
- big generous hugs ( i love hugs) 

features : 

- easy to read card images
- highly scaleable, not a hard coded "deck" but one that can easily change size
- most blackjack games have a hidden dealer card, but i thought hey, thats just removing part of the experience, so i left it out

future improvements: 

- in coming patches developers will be working on a new card type (hint: the ACE will equal 1 OR 11)
- in coming patches developers will be adding a betting / valuation system for bets
- in coming patches developers will be creating a better game
- patch notes coming soon!
